TODO.txt for bstamp: BASIC Stamp Tools for Linux


May 15, 2004

General To-Do:

  * Figure out cause of timeouts
  * Clean-up command-line options (e.g., add "--help" along with "-h", etc.)
  * Improve documentation

Comments from Francis Esmonde-White:

  * It would be really nice to advance the debugger by making it an interactive
    serial session between the stamp and the terminal.
  * I'd like to make a similar utility for the parallax sx-key programmer,
    but parallax doesn't seem as keen as me on making it happen.
