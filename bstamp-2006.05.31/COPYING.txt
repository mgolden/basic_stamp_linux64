This archive contains code licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

  bstamp_run.cpp
  bstamp_tokenize.cpp   [ based on example code from Parallax, Inc. ]

Please see GPL.txt for the full license.



This archive ALSO currently contains code and a binary shared library object
licensed under the Parallax PBASIC Tokenizer Software License.

  tokenizer.h
  tokenizer.so

Please see PBASIC_Tokenizer_Software_Distribution_License.txt
(or the PDF PBASIC_Tokenizer_Software_Distribution_License.pdf)
for the full license.


DO NOT USE OR DISTRIBUTE THIS SOFTWARE UNTIL FULFILLING THE REQUIREMENTS
OF THESE LICENSES!



Note:  The PBASIC Tokenizer license is fairly incompatible with the GPL.
       (Points 2, 4, 5, 6, and others.)  Due to this, I feel we should no
       longer distribute Parallax's code and binary in this archive.
       The software is available as a free download from www.parallax.com.
       At that point, the end-user will need to deal with Parallax's license.

       The Atari800 project (http://atari800.atari.org/) does something
       similar to this when it uses the Atari OS ROMs which were distributed
       (with permission from Atari) with the demo version of PC Xformer 2.5.
