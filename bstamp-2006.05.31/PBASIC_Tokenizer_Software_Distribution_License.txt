BASIC Stamp Development Environments to be developed on multiple platforms.   
 
For rights of use beyond the scope of this License, please contact the named
Parallax Trademark and Intellectual Property Manager at the contact information

LICENSE TERMS 
 
  1. Existing Software is Copyright by Parallax Licensee may copy and
     distribute copies of the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software as received,
     in any medium, provided that Licensee appropriately publish on each copy
     release that the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software is copyright
     Parallax, Inc. 2002; a disclaimer of warranty; and that any recipients
     receive a full copy of this License either in print or included with the
     media, as well as during software downloads from the internet. 
 
  2. Distributed for No Charge Only. You may not charge for or receive any
     compensation in any form for the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software
     itself. Contact Parallax's Trademark and Intellectual Property Manager
     if distributing pay-for software is part of your business plan.   
 
  3. Limited Development Support from Parallax. The PBASIC Tokenizer Library
     software is offered, as is, with development support only to the extent
     of topics related specifically to the PBASIC Tokenizer Library that are
     not sufficiently documented.  Parallax will not provide support for
     anything outside of the above, including inquiries pertaining to linking
     to specific languages, environments, etc.   
 
  4. Distribution of Software Requires Signed Agreement.  If Licensee plans on
     distributing a copy of the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software, Parallax
     requires that Licensee submit a copy of each Licensee signed agreement
     relating to that PBASIC Tokenizer Library software using the contact 
     information shown at the bottom indicating that Licensee agrees to the
     terms of this License and will administer the protections provided
     Parallax in all subsequent Licenses issued by Licensee.  
      
  5. License Limitations. Licensee may not copy, modify, sublicense, or
     distribute the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software except as expressly
     provided under this License. Any attempt to copy or otherwise modify,
     sublicense or distribute the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software is void,
     and will automatically terminate these Licensed rights to make any
     further distribution. Should Licensee desire to broaden these Licensed
     rights contact our Trademark and Intellectual Property Manager to
     negotiate an amendment to this agreement. Parties who have received
     copies, or rights, or Licenses from you under this License will not
     have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
     compliance.  
 
  6. Signed License Required. To effectuate this license you must return the
     signed copy to Parallax Inc. (with a copy of the licensee's drivers
     license) to the contact person shown below by fax or mail.
 
  7. License Transfers with Software. Each time Licensee redistributes the
     PBASIC Tokenizer Library software, the recipient must automatically
     receive a license with a copy of the original License before being
     allowed to copy and distribute the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software
     subject to these terms and conditions. Licensee may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
     herein. Licensee is not responsible for enforcing compliance by 
     third parties to this License, though any recipient who chooses to
     distribute the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software is subject to the
     Licensee restrictions set forth in paragraph five.
      
  8. WARRANTY. There is no warranty for the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software.
     Parallax provides the PBASIC Tokenizer Library software "as is", without
     warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. The entire risk as to
     the quality and performance of the software lies with the recipient.

  9. No Parallax Liability. In no event will Parallax be liable to Licensee
     and or third party for damages; including general, special, incidental
     or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
     software (including but not limited to loss of data or data being
     rendered inaccurate or losses sustained to you by 3rd parties), even if
     such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such
     damages. Parallax will not be liable for any designs using
     PBASIC Tokenizer Library software that might result in injury, death or
     any damage to or beyond the user's cost of the product Licensed or
     purchased from Parallax. Licensee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless,
     defend and protect Parallax against any claims for damages to property
     or injury or death of any persons asserted to arise out of any use of
     this Licensed PBASIC Tokenizer Library software.
  
 10. No Rights to Parallax Hardware. If a recipient of our PBASIC Tokenizer
     Library software attempts to create and sell a BASIC Stamp device
     (that does not use original Parallax PBASIC Interpreter chips), their
     License is immediately invalid. In this case the Licensee and each
     sub-License acknowledges that Parallax will pursue all required further
     action, either legally or through mediation, to protect its interests
     between the two parties. 
     
 11. Parallax may Refuse License. Parallax, Inc. reserves the right to
     refuse to grant or continue any license for any reason, including
     reasons listed in the above paragraphs.
