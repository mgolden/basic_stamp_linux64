NOTE: There are two ways you can compile and install bside.

   1)  As the root (super) user. (NOT RECOMMENDED)
   2)  Using the 'sudo' command.

If you do not have the 'sudo' binary installed please
search for the package (or source) using your favorite
search engine and install it before proceeding.  Please
make sure you've added your user to the /etc/sudoers 
file.   

COMPILATION/INSTALLATION:

Steps to Install
	1.) Download Source
	2.) Unpack Source
	3.) Compiling


Step 1:
Download the latest snapshot or stable release from:

   http://devscott.org/projects/bside

and save it in a directory of your choice. 

Step 2:

After downloading the file,  untar the file.  If you are unfamiliar with
tar please execute the following command from the command
line: 'man tar' (without the single quotes).  If that is not
helpful please try the following:

   tar -xvf bside-(release).tar

   OR   

   tar -xzvf bside-(release).tar.gz 

You can ommit the -v option if you do not wish to see tar's 
progress.  

Step 3: 
Now that we've "unpacked" the bside source you have one of two
installation options:


Installing as root:

	    Execute the following 
  	    command, then at the prompt, type your
            root password and press enter:

            su -

            The dash/switch will give you full rights
            as root user and also change you to the
            root home directory.  You do not have to 
            use the dash/switch option but it's the
            safest option to avoid installation problems.

            If you used the dash/switch please change
            back to the bside directory.  Once you've
            changed to the proper directory, we 
            recommend you do the following before 
            creating the binaries if you've
            installed previous versions of bside:

            make clean 
  
            After you've "cleaned" up you can 
            make the 'bside_tokenizer' and 'bside'
            binaries by typing:

            make 

            Once you've made the binaries you can install
            them by typing:
            
            make install

            ---------------------------------------------------
            NOTE: None of the below will be necessary on a
            modern machine with a USB port instead of a serial.
            ---------------------------------------------------

            If necessary make com1 and com2 serial ports:

            MAKEDEV /dev/ttyS0 (NOTE: Use a zero not an 'O'.)
            MAKEDEV /dev/ttyS1             

            If you have setup a symbolic link to the serial port,
            you can use the link by passing it with the -d argument
            at run time.  Please see help (bside -h) for usage.

            You might also have to change the permissions on
            your serial ports.  To do that you can select the
            one you wish to use and issue the following command
            as the root user:

            chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0 

            OR

            chmod 666 /dev/ttySx  (where x is the number of the port)

            Voila, you should now be able to use the     
            command line version of bside.  


Installing using sudo:

	    Once you've installed the 'sudo' binary (or source)
            you can issue the following commands:

            make clean

            make (or 'make all')

            sudo make install

            ---------------------------------------------------
            NOTE: None of the below will be necessary on a
            modern machine with a USB port instead of a serial.
            ---------------------------------------------------

            If necessary make com1 or com2 serial port:

            sudo MAKEDEV /dev/ttyS0  (NOTE: Use a zero not an 'O'.)
            sudo MAKEDEV /dev/ttyS1 

            If you have setup a symbolic link to the serial port, 
            you can use the link by passing it with the -d argument
            at run time.  Please see help (bside -h) for usage. 

            You might also have to change the permissions on your
            serial ports.  To do that you can select the one you 
            wish to use and issue the following command
            as the root user:

            chmod 666 /dev/ttyS0
  
            OR

            chmod 666 /dev/ttySx  (where x is the number of the port)

            Voila, you should now be able to use the 
            command line version of bside.

            ---------------------------------------------------


USB NOTES:    As you might have noticed we didn't mention anything
              about USB support.  As it stands now, USB support is
              EXPERIMENTAL but we know the current implementation
              of bside USB support works, but we haven't fully
              documented the features.  As an aside, the USB
              interface chipset has native Linux support.              
  
              The Parallax and many other companies use an FTDI
	      USB chipset to interface. An FTDI driver is included in
	      all kernels passed 2.4.?. If your kernel is missing this 
	      driver, please see your distrobutions documention on including it.

              Once it is loaded as a module, you'll notice that it
              attaches to /dev/ttyUSB0:

              tail /var/log/messages | grep ttyUSB0

	      You may then pass this device to bside by using the -d argument

		Example:   bside -d /dev/ttyUSB0
