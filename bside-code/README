About:
------
	BSide aims to be a full integraded development environment for the Basic Stamp line of microcontrollers. 

Which Stamps are Supported?:
----------------------------
	To view a full list of supported stamps, see http://www.devscott.org/projects/bside/stamps.htm

	Parallax (http://www.parallax.com)
		BS2, BS2e, BS2sx, BS2p40, BS2pe, BS2px,	BS2p24
	Coridium (http://www.coridiumcorp.com)
		ARMexpress

Compiling:
----------
	You should simply be able to run "make" to compile the tools from source.

Installing:
-----------
	Steps to install
		1.) > make clean
		2.) > make
		3.) > sudo make install

	if necessary (almost certainly not), make the com1 or com2 serial port
  		> MAKEDEV /dev/ttyS0	(For com1)
		> MAKEDEV /dev/ttyS1	(For com2)

  	If you have set up a symbolic link to the serial port, you can use this link by passing the -d argument at run time. See help for usage

	USB support requires the FTDI driver. This driver is included in the Linux kernel, but might not be enabled. See your distribution documentation for enabling the driver. USB boards should appear as /dev/ttyUSB0, which is now the default device.

Known Issues:
-------------
	None at this time

About the PBasic Tokenizer Library:
----------------------------
  	The tokenizer is by Parallax, Inc., and released as a shared object (.so). As of this writing, it is only available as a binary (no source code), and only for x86-based Linux systems.

	It is available, along with example code (upon which some of the code here is based) and documentation, from this page at Parallax's website: http://www.parallax.com/html_pages/downloads/tokenizer/tokenizer.asp

About the BASIC Examples
-------------------------
	
	Included are a bunch of simple examples to test your stamp. (located in examples/) Description for each are listed below.
