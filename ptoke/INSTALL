Ptoke - The Linux Pbasic Tokenizer Front end for BASIC Stamp II



Brief Description:

This is a Linux command line utility to reprocesses, tokenize, and "burn"
PBasic source files to Parallax Inc.'s Basic Stamp II series of
microprocessors.



Requirements:

PBASIC_Tokenizer.tar.gz library installed.  This can be found at:
http://www.parallax.com/html_pages/downloads/tokenizer/tokenizer.asp

m4 is not required, but to make life easier while working on big projects I 
suggest making sure its in your path ( you'd be surprised how much 
memory a stamp 2e has...)  m4 is a text macro preprocessor that provides
sanity for large projects.

I personally find the basic-mode.el proglet for emacs handy for hacking
Basic Stamp source.



Installation:

First download and install the PBASIC Tokenizer lib from above.  Then do
something similar to this (must be root user):

foobar# tar -xzf PBASIC_Tokenizer.tar.gz
foobar# cd linux
foobar# cp tokenizer.so /usr/local/lib/libtoken.so
foobar# chmod 755 /usr/local/lib/libtoken.so
foobar# ldconfig

Basically:  unzip the tar ball, rename and move the lib to your
/usr/local/lib directory, chmod, and ldconfig the ldd service. be Careful 
with the libtoken.so filename, as ptoke depends on finding this lib.

All set? Good.  Now edit Makefile for your personal settings (bin dir)
and save. do:

foobar$ make
foobar$ make install

You should now have 2 executables in your bin directory:  ptoke, and pblast.  
ptoke makes the object files and pblast uploads them to your stamp.
